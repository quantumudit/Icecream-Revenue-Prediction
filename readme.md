## Overview

The project aims to create a web application that enables end users to predict the potential revenue of their ice cream business based on the temperature of a given day.

The application utilizes a trained model that has been developed using historical data, incorporating information on both revenue and temperature.

By leveraging this model, users can input the current temperature and obtain an estimation of the revenue they can expect to generate for their ice cream business on that particular day.

The web application serves as a valuable tool for ice cream business owners to make informed decisions and plan their operations accordingly, taking into account the anticipated revenue based on temperature patterns.

The repository directory structure is as follows:

Icecream-Revenue-Prediction<br>
├─ 01_DATA<br>
├─ 02_EXPERIMENTS<br>
├─ 03_MODELS<br>
├─ 04_APP<br>
├─ 05_RESOURCES<br>

The type of content present in the directories is as follows:

### 01_DATA

This directory contains the data that can be directly used for data analysis and visualization.

The contents of this directory include only the pristine and organized [data](/01_DATA/icecream_data.csv), ready to be utilized for data analysis and visualization.

This data has been thoroughly processed and scrubbed of any errors or inconsistencies, ensuring that it can be relied upon to provide accurate and meaningful insights.

### 02_EXPERIMENTS

This directory houses a [Jupyter Notebook](02_EXPERIMENTS/revenue_prediction_model.ipynb). This notebook serves as a central location for analyzing the dataset and building a machine learning model capable of predicting outcomes based on a specific set of features.

By leveraging this notebook, we can explore and manipulate the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different variables

Additionally, the notebook guides us through the process of training a machine learning model using the dataset, enabling us to make accurate predictions based on the provided features.

### 03_MODELS

Within this directory, we have a [pickle file](03_MODELS/icecream_linear_model.pkl) that houses the best performing model out of all the experiments conducted. This model has been carefully selected based on its superior performance and accuracy in predicting desired outcomes.

The pickle file format ensures that the model is stored in a serialized format, allowing for easy retrieval and utilization in various applications.

By leveraging this pickle file, you can seamlessly integrate the high-performing model into web applications. This means that the model can be readily employed to provide accurate predictions and make informed decisions within the context of a web-based environment.

### 04_APP

This directory contains the [python script](04_APP/app.py) and related files that collectively play a crucial role in creating and empowering the web application.

The script and related files serves as the backbone of the application, orchestrating its functionality and defining its behavior.

### 06_RESOURCES

This directory serves as a repository for various visual elements used in this project, including images, icons, layouts, styling files, etc.

These elements play a crucial role in the overall presentation and visualization of the data and help to bring the insights generated by the analysis to life.

By having these elements easily accessible in a central location, the project is streamlined and efficient, allowing for faster and more effective data analysis and visualization.

![Process Architecture][process_workflow]

The project architecture consists of the following steps:

- **ML Experiments**: Involves conducting machine learning experiments to analyze the data and develop predictive models.
- **Best Performing Model**: The best performing model from the ML experiments is identified and selected for further use based on its superior performance and accuracy.
- **Web Application**: Involves building a user-friendly web application that utilizes the selected model, enabling users to make predictions and gain valuable insights.

These steps are designed to be straightforward and efficient, allowing for quick and effective analysis of the data and generation of meaningful insights.
